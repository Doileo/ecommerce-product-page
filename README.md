## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for classes
- Lighthouse for performance and accessibility

### What I learned

Through this project, I have developed my ability to:

- Build a lightbox gallery feature that activates when images are clicked.
- Implement a slider to cycle through large product images.
- Enable users to add products to their shopping cart.
- Develop a shopping cart interface that displays selected items and allows for their removal.

Additionally, I tackled some extended tasks:

- Implemented a feature to sort products on the Men and Women pages.
- Developed detailed product pages for individual items on the Men and Women pages.
- Added a "Back to Top" button for improved navigation.

### Continued development

Looking ahead, I am excited to build another e-commerce project using React. In this future project, I plan to:

- Add size options for products, along with a size chart for users to consult.
- Implement a "heart" favorite feature to allow users to save their favorite items.
- Include a slider for product models that lets users preview different models before accessing their details.

I am eager to apply what I've learned and expand on these features to create a more interactive and user-friendly shopping experience.

### Useful resources

- [Lighthouse Documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) - This documentation was crucial for optimizing the performance and accessibility of the site. It guided me through using Lighthouse for auditing and improving various aspects of the project.

- [BEM Methodology](https://getbem.com/introduction/) - This resource helped me learn and implement the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for my CSS classes. It made my code more readable and maintainable, and I plan to continue using this methodology in future projects.

- [W3Schools - JavaScript Array sort()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp) - This resource was extremely helpful for implementing the sorting feature for products on the Men and Women pages. The examples and explanations provided a clear understanding of how to use the `sort()` method effectively.
