## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the thumbnail images
- Switch the large product image using a slider

Extended Tasks:
In addition to the initial project requirements, I have completed the following extended tasks:

- Added another color to the buttons, considering the rotation aspect.
- Created pages for each model on the Men and Women pages.
